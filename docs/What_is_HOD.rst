What is hanythingondemand?
==========================

hanythingondemand is a set of scripts to start a Hadoop cluster from within another resource management system
(e.g., Torque/PBS). It allows traditional users of HPC systems to experiment with Hadoop or use it as a
production setup if there is no dedicated setup available.
