Run HanythingOnDemand (or HOD for short)

Goal:
  
 Start on-demand Hadoop setup on cluster infrastructure (eg Torque based HPC setup) 
 as part of a batch job. 
 It allows people to experiment with Hadoop or use it as production setup, if 
 there is no dedicated setup available.

History:

 Hadoop used to ship it's own HOD (Hadoop On Demand) but it was non-maintained 
 and only supported Hadoop without tuning. (The HOD code that was shipped with 
 Hadoop 1.0.0 release was buggy to say the least.)
 An attempt was made to make it work on UGent HPC infrastructure, but although 
 a working Hadoop cluster was realised, it was a nightmare to extend it's functionality.
 At that point (April 2012) HanythingOnDemand was started to be better maintainable and support more 
 tuning and functionality out of the box (eg HBase was minimum requirement), hence it's name.
 Apart from the acronym HOD nothing of the Hadoop On Demand was reused.

Prerequisites

* environment-modules (used to test HOD) to manage the environment
 * this is optional if everything is setup and usable (eg PATH, JAVA_HOME, PYTHONPATH)
* python with mpi4py
 * eg on fedora 'yum install -y mpi4py-mpich2'
 * install with Easybuild (https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild)
* java 
 * oracle JDK 
 * FC16 java-1.6.0-openjdk-1.6.0.0-65.1.11.1.fc16.x86_64
 * also installable with Easybuild
* hadoop binaries
 * eg the cloudera distribution versions (used to test HOD)
 * also installable with Easybuild

Preparation 
* if the environment is not usable (eg for localhost usage)
 * create a small script so that the environment is setup
 * eg FC16
  * download hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u3.tar.gz in $HOME/hadoop/cdh3u3 and unpack
  * install mpi4py and java: yum install -y mpi4py-mpich2 java-1.6.0-openjdk
  * install HanythingOnDemand in $HOME/hod
  * sourcing the following script will setup the correct environment

cat > $HOME/hod/localenv <<EOF

module load mpich2-x86_64
HODPATH=$HOME/hod
if [ -z $PYTHONPATH ]
then
    export PYTHONPATH=$HODPATH
else
    export PYTHONPATH=$HODPATH:$PYTHONPATH
fi
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java
export PATH=$HOME/hadoop/cdh3u3/hadoop-0.20.2-cdh3u3/bin:$HODPATH/bin/:$PATH

EOF
 
 * use hod with option --hod_envscript=$HOME/hod/localenv

Usage:
* localhost
 * set the environment
 * hod.py
  * don't forget the --hod_envscript option
* cluster
 * use hod_pbs.py for pbs support
